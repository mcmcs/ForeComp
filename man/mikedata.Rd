\description{
A dataset containing y, f1, f2 based on one of McCracken (2019)'s data generating processes.
The name of the specification is "Unconditional-Rolling".
R = 175, Rbar = 175, h = 12, P = 75;
Note that the DGP is constructed in a way that there is no difference between f1 and f2 in terms of expected quadratic loss.
