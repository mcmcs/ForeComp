\usage{
dm.test.im(d, q = 2, cl = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{loss differential}

\item{q}{number of blocks. When \code{length(d)} is not divisible by
\code{q}, this implementation uses near-equal nonoverlapping blocks
(block sizes differ by at most one) and issues a warning.}

\item{cl}{confidence level (default = 0.05, i.e., 5\%)}
}
\value{
This function returns a class with the following elements
\itemize{
\item \code{rej} is a T/F value. TRUE (reject), FALSE (accept)
\item \code{stat} is a test statistic
\item \code{pval} is an associated p-value
