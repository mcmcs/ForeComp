Description: Offers tools for visualizing and analyzing size and power properties
    of tests for equal predictive accuracy, including the Diebold-Mariano test
    based on heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation-robust (HAR) inference. HAR
    inference involves nonparametric estimation of the long-run variance, and a
    key tuning parameter (the truncation parameter) trades off size and power.
    Lazarus, Lewis, and Stock (2021) <doi:10.3982/ECTA15404> theoretically
    characterize the size-power frontier for the Gaussian multivariate location
    model. ForeComp computes and visualizes the finite-sample size-power
    frontier of the Diebold-Mariano test based on fixed-b asymptotics together
    with the Bartlett kernel. To compute finite-sample size and power, it fits
    a best approximating ARMA process to the input data and reports how the
    truncation parameter performs and how robust testing outcomes are to its
    choice.
